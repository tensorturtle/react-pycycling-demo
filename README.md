# [React](https://react.dev/) frontend for [Pycycling](https://github.com/zacharyedwardbull/pycycling)

Hit the ground running for your full-stack bluetooth project.
This app is a clean, minimal demonstration of a React frontend that controls a Python flask server to scan and connect to bluetooth devices.
For demonstration purposes, we use [pycycling]([https://](https://github.com/zacharyedwardbull/pycycling) library to read and parse data from cycling-specific bluetooth devices. It is trivial to use your own parsers for other bluetooth devices.

Note, while we have reached MVP, this is a work in progress. I recommend you star this repo and look out for versioned updates.
